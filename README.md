This repository contains fun little coding projects that I have worked on or am working on! Here's what it contains so far.


## **Rock paper scissors:**

This is a text-based rock paper scissors game.

### **RPS** 
RPS was the original design. It is just plain ol' "Rock-Paper-Scissors." It is coded a bit inefficiently using if statements, so I re-wrote it and that is why RPS2.0 exists.

### **RPS2.0**
RPS 2.0 was made using dictionaries and is overall more efficient than the first attempt. The logic of the game as well as the gameplay are the exact same, however the code is simpler using dictionaries; this allows the game to be easily changed and expanded as well. You can also change the text that is displayed when one move beats the other from within the same dictionary. For example: "Rock *crushes* scissors!"


### **RPSLS** 
This version is Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, based on the game from the Big Bang theory! It expands upon the dictionaries in the 2.0 version and takes advantage of its flexibility to create this more complicated game. The game logic is as follows:

* Scissors cuts Paper
* Paper covers Rock
* Rock crushes Lizard
* Lizard poisons Spock
* Spock smashes Scissors
* Scissors decapitates Lizard
* Lizard eats Paper
* Paper disproves Spock
* Spock vaporizes Rock
* (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors

### **Game-Final** 
This is a merged version of both games; you can play both regular Rock-Paper-Scissors as long as Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock. You can choose which game to play and there is a scoreboard from each game played, so you can view your statistics from each of the games played.
